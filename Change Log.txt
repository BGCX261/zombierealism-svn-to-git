    * Added HUD element for rank XP (shows +5, etc).
    * Started on the in-game customize class feature (only at beginning of game, before it begins - for now).
    * Changed settings so the first round does not start until at least one player is spawned and actually playing (gotta add more to the code to avoid issues, but it will work for now).

[01/29/10]
    * Changed - Lighting has been changed in Nacht Der Untoten.
    * Added - Started adding challenges and other stats tracking for each individual weapon (it's gonna take a while because I have to convert them from MP to be compatible with SP, but it will definitely be worth it).
    * Added - Engineers must now repair perk machines before they can be used by anyone (this may be different in the final version, since Der Riese and Verruckt have power).

[01/30/10]
    * Added - 2 new powerups have been added: Berserker and Incendiary Damage.
    * Changed - Zombies now spawn faster and run faster. Their health has only increased a little (so it isn't extremely hard).
